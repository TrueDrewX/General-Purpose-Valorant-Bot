   DISCORD_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token_here
   API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

2. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Ensure your `.env` file is correctly formatted and saved in the projectâ€™s root directory. The `.env` file should not be included in version control, as it contains sensitive information. Make sure your `.gitignore` file includes:
